# Strelka2-Manta
This repo contains scripts to run Strelka2 and Manta on tumor/normal BAM file pairs,
plus scripts to do postprocessing.

## Make_MantaDirectories.sh
This script creates the directories for Manta SV calling, pulling the basename of the BAM files as dir name.
It creates a subfolder <Somatic> or <Germline> in each of these. 
Can simply be run in the same folder as the BAM files without any options.
  
## Make_StrelkaDirectories.sh  
Same as the ```Make_MantaDirectories.sh```but for Strelka2. Can only be run after Manta workflow has 
finished because the ```candidateSmallIndels.vcf.gz``` must be passed to Strelka2.

## start_slurms.sh
This script loops through the created directories and submits the jobs to SLURM.
Has to be run first for Manta directories. 
Once this is finished, ```Make_StrelkaDirectories.sh``` can be executed.

## Strelka2_postprocessing.sh
This script postprocesses the somatic calls from Strelka2.
Can be executed via ```start_Strelka2_postprocessing.sh``` from the base directory.
Will remove non-PASSED variants, variants in low-complexity regions,
variants that are COMMON=1 in dbSNP151/1KG, add allele frequency to the VCF,
and create one merged VCF.gz for each sample.
A symbolic link for each of these files is created in ```./Final_Variants```.

## To Do
Write something that postprocesses the Manta calls, excluding or blacklisting breakpoints that are
in LC regions.
